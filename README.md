In our second trimester at Holberton, we tackled higher level programming languages. It was interesting to see how different Python and Javascript are from C. In this trimester we also started using testing protocols for our code. Using the skills we learned, our group projects focused on creating an AirBnB clone.

Here is a sample of some of the projects in this repository:
1. [Python introduction](https://github.com/JfHarris/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-python-hello_world)
2. [Python testing](https://github.com/JfHarris/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x0C-python-almost_a_circle)
3. [Working with SQL](https://github.com/JfHarris/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-SQL_more_queries)
4. [Javascript and JQuery](https://github.com/JfHarris/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-javascript-web_jquery)
